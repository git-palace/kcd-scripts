## The problem

I do a bunch of open source and want to make it easier to maintain so many
projects.

## This solution

This is a CLI that abstracts away all configuration for my open source projects
for linting, testing, building, and more.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev kcd-scripts
```

## Usage

This is a CLI and exposes a bin called `kcd-scripts`. I don't really plan on
documenting or testing it super duper well because it's really specific to my
needs. You'll find all available scripts in `src/scripts`.

This project actually dogfoods itself. If you look in the `package.json`, you'll
find scripts with `node src {scriptName}`. This serves as an example of some
of the things you can do with `kcd-scripts`.

## Inspiration

This is inspired by `react-scripts`.

## Other Solutions

I'm not aware of any, if you are please [make a pull request][prs] and add it
here! Again, this is a very specific-to-me solution.
